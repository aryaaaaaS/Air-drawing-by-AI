# Air-drawing-by-AI
A real-time AI-powered air drawing system that allows users to draw shapes using their fingers in the air, track movements through webcam using MediaPipe and OpenCV, and predict drawn shapes using a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). 
# ✍️ Air Drawing AI - Real-Time Shape Predictor

Draw shapes in the air using just your fingers, and watch AI detect what you've drawn — all in real time! Powered by Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
